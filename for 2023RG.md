1. **GIT** - you should love it. When you get familiar with ideas and logic, Git will inspire you. <br>Try to do it as earlier as possible.
2. **Mac === Brew.** Only NVM outside of brew. <br>Brew is the simplest way to manage a lot of developers' instruments for mac.
3. shell (zsh, bash) - please consider everything you do is in the **zsh**. Therefore, be careful when you follow tutorials with recommendations about .zsrc, .bash_profile, etc. Yours way is **.zprofile**. 
4. **.env** - care your time. You will spend a lot of time if you forget 		
.env (vs code) **!=** .env (apple terminal)

<mark style="background: #00ced1!important">`lessons`</mark>

1. **Time** - the courses are extra intensive. Therefore, you should be ready to spend a minimum of 2 hours every day after class—usually, 3-4 hours to repeat the material or read the literature.
2. **Studying is your job** - take it into account. Refrain from trying to combine learning with intensive work or active private life. It would help if you were to concentrate on studying and be involved in the process.
3. **Youtube guides** - you will spend a lot of time following any courses. Yes, some of them are useful. But you will understand that it is "old" courses or unacceptable for you when you are in the middle of them.
4. **Extra materials** - the _best way is to follow teacher materials_. the best way is to follow teacher materials. Margit and Santosh have great lectures. Also, they will give you literature. I can assure you that spending time on reading material is more effective than following youtube courses.
5. **Following teachers materials** you will have main things - you will not be familiar with the programming languages, courses, etc., but you will understand them.
6. **Repeat lecture material before lesson.** Yes, it works. More effective to do it the day before, not on the way to the lecture in 20 minutes.
7. **Screenshots** - it depends on your type of memory. For a "visual" person, it may be helpful. I did a lot of. Inside each course, I had a folder like "react _ less _ screenshots". But I used only 10% of them.
8. Since the middle of the courses, I started to make **notes in .md** files. That is more useful than screenshots. Command snippets, hints, etc, you can put into .md files. That is extra useful.

1. **To do on time == to do x 2** Following the course schedule give you possibilities to be interesting for the teacher as a student. Therefore you will have a chance to ask additional questions and have extra knowledge.
2. **Better to have finalized solution or code than "unique"** but "under construction". If you are a student, you have maybe a 10% chance to amaze your teacher. But your main task is how to "sell" yourself as a developer in the future. Nobody likes developers that stop working in the middle of them.
3. **Don't postpone coding.** Anytime you will need "extra" time, trust me.
4. **Refrain from replacing the solution with the result.** When you don't understand some of them, you can follow another solution from the internet or your friend. Do not do that. The result is crucial for you, not for the teacher. Try to figure out how it should work, not how to solve it in any way.

<mark style="background: #00ced1!important">`team working`</mark>

1. **You are the team** It means that you are responsible for the teamwork and team members. Nobody will push you. Only you are.
2. **You are adult and responsive** - you shouldn't do the work of your team members. Some types of people have a lot of reasons to do only part of the task, postpone it, etc. But that is not yours, "monkey on the shoulders".
3. **Separate tasks.** Teamwork is about work. It means each of them should do their stuff and can describe them to other team members—each team member. 
4. **That is the power of a team - all of them do stuff.** Even if you do not understand some materials - you can do styling, you can do templates, you can be Scrum, etc, or inspire other team members, but not only "I don't understand". All of them have meanings.

<mark style="background: #d1000d!important">`PHP or NODE.JS`</mark>

1. **PHP give you possibilities to be familiar with DRUPAL** To my mind DRUPAL is great. Really. Complex system. Great community. You can play with them and understand a lot. To my mind, having a real system for training is essential.
2. Based on the PHP principles, you can learn NODE.JS by yourself. Therefore, you will have a stable base and area for growth. In the case only NODE.JS, you will lose a chance to do a complex project on a DRUPAL base that is necessary for the consolidation of knowledge.
